Libre Excel Tools for Data Science

Libre Excel Tools for Data Science (LET4DataSsci) is a set of open source tools for Excel 
to help with various data science and analysis tasks.  LET4DataSci includes libraries of 
user defined functions (UDFs), classes, and sub-routines that can be used in your formulas, 
macros, and VBA code.  LET4DataSci also includes component “templates” that can be copied 
and pasted into your own spreadsheets. At this point, the number of tools LET4DataSci offers 
is limited to those I developed to handle some of the data science tasks I have faced so far.  
But, with this as a start, I hope others will join the project, and that the number of tools 
will expand over time to become a fuller set.
